# COMPLEX NETWORKS APPROACH FOR DYNAMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF NONLINEAR SYSTEMS

Implementation of two algorithms for dynamical characterization of nonlinear systems using complex networks:
⋅⋅* Dynamical Characterization with the Top Integral Function (DCTIF)
⋅⋅* Dynamical Characterization with Symbolic Dynamics (DCSD) 


Collaborators: Vander L. S. Freitas, Juliana C. Lacerda and Elbert E. N. Macau.



Dependencies (tested on python 2.7):

⋅⋅* matplotlib
⋅⋅* igraph
⋅⋅* networkx



How to run all the simulations from our paper:

```
bash reproduce_all_results.sh
```
